USB to Serial Chip CH340：
Overview
CH340 is a USB bus adapter chip, to achieve USB to serial port, USB to IrDA infrared or USB to print port.
In the serial port mode, CH340 provides common MODEM contact signal, which is used to extend the asynchronous serial port for the computer or directly upgrade the ordinary serial port device to the USB bus.

Features
Full-speed USB device interface, compatible with USB V2.0, peripheral components only need crystals and capacitors.
Emulation standard serial port, used to upgrade the original serial peripherals, or through USB additional serial port.
Computer-side Windows operating system serial applications are fully compatible, without modification.
Hardware full duplex serial port, built-in send and receive buffer, support communication baud rate 50bps ~ 2Mbps.
Support common MODEM contact signal RTS, DTR, DCD, RI, DSR, CTS.
Through the addition of level conversion devices, providing RS232, RS485, RS422 and other interfaces.
Support IrDA standard SIR infrared communication, support baud rate 2400bps to 115200bps.
CH341 software compatible, you can directly use the CH341 driver.
Supports 5V supply voltage and 3.3V supply voltage.
